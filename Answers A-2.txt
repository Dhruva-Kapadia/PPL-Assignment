A-2 Conditional Jumps and Control Flow Graphs
---------------------------------------------

1. if blocks get translated as a series of goto statements. The statements inside the if block get executed inside the goto blocks and the control is passed back to the calling function. 
The difference between conditional gotos and unconditional gotos is that a conditional goto blocks will get control only if said condition is true else control wont go to statement. However unconditional gotos will get control atleast once.

2. Yes cfg dumps are easier to read than gimple dumps.

Additional: The ternary operator is handled like an if else statement in C with conditional gotos.
